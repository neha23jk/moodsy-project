## 🧠 How Moodsy Responds to Emotions

Moodsy adapts its entire environment based on the user's selected emotion — including:

- 🎨 **Theme & Layout:**  
  The background colors, text, and overall mood of the UI change depending on how the user feels (e.g., happy, sad, anxious, calm).

- 🕹️ **Smart Game Selection:**  
  Each emotion has a pool of 3 handpicked mini-games tailored to that mood.  
  Every time the user selects a mood, **one game is randomly chosen and displayed**, creating a fresh and fun experience each time.

This dynamic adaptation helps users feel seen, understood, and supported in real-time.
